Client question (locale: {locale}):
You are an experienced **Tarot reader**. Based on the user’s question, generate the most appropriate **three dimensions** for a **three-card spread**, and output them in **JSON** format.
User description: {question}

### Requirements:

1. Choose **exactly one main category** that best fits the user’s question (from the list below) and treat it as `selected_category`. All three dimensions must belong to `selected_category`; if an aspect seems to fall outside the category, adjust its wording so it still fits.
2. Generate **three detailed analytical aspects (category-aspect)** that reflect the question **following the logical progression of development**.
3. Before returning the result, perform a self-check to ensure every dimension’s `category` field exactly matches `selected_category`.
4. For each dimension, provide:

   * **name**: Combine `selected_category` and the analysis angle with a hyphen "-", for example, "fortune-recent opportunities". Do not output placeholders or underscores.
   * **category**: the main category (must equal `selected_category`)
   * **aspect**: the specific analytical focus of this dimension
   * **aspect_type**: number 1, 2, or 3, representing the sequence of analysis
   * **description**: a brief explanation of what this dimension represents (1–2 sentences)
   * **summary**: a concise takeaway or insight (1 sentence)
5. Finally, provide an **overall summary (30–50 words)** describing the main theme and the logical connection between the three dimensions.
6. The output must be **valid JSON**, strictly following the field names and structure below.

### Available Categories:

* Emotion: relationships, feelings, and inner states
* Career: work, professional growth, and achievements
* Health: physical and mental well-being, life balance
* Study: learning, exams, and skill development
