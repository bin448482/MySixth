While this may initially seem daunting, remember that endings pave the way for new beginnings.\n\nIn the context of your overall trend, Death suggests that you may experience a period of closure or completion in various aspects of your life. This could manifest as the resolution of long-standing issues, the conclusion of projects, or the shedding of old habits. Embrace these changes with an open heart, as they are essential for your growth and evolution.\n\nAs you navigate this period of transition, trust in the process and have faith that the universe is guiding you towards a brighter future. Embrace the opportunities that come your way, even if they initially seem challenging. Remember, every ending is a chance for rebirth and renewal.\n\nIn the coming month, stay open to new possibilities and be willing to release what no longer serves your highest good. Embrace the transformative energy of Death and allow it to lead you towards a more fortunate and fulfilling path.",
