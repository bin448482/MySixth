This resistance may stem from a fear of the unknown or a tendency towards self-doubt and harsh self-criticism. It suggests that you may be holding yourself back from seizing promising chances due to lingering doubts or a reluctance to forgive past mistakes.\n\nTo navigate this energy, it is crucial to cultivate a mindset of forgiveness and acceptance. Let go of any lingering judgments, whether towards yourself or others, and open yourself up to the possibilities that await. Embrace a more compassionate outlook towards yourself and others, allowing room for growth and transformation.\n\nRemember that external opportunities often mirror our internal state, so by releasing self-doubt and criticism, you pave the way for positive changes to manifest in your external circumstances.
