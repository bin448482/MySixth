The King of Cups in this context may indicate that the person in question is using their emotions as a tool to control the situation or avoid facing deeper truths.\n\nTo navigate this dynamic, it is essential to approach the relationship with a sense of emotional maturity and honesty.

Pay attention to non-verbal cues and make an effort to rebuild trust and connection through body language that conveys openness, empathy, and understanding. Encourage active listening and strive to create a safe space for both individuals to express their feelings and concerns without judgment.\n\nAdditionally, consider seeking the guidance of a professional counselor or mediator to facilitate constructive dialogue and help navigate through the complexities of the relationship. Remember that body language can speak volumes, so be mindful of your own gestures and expressions to ensure that they align with your intentions and emotions.
