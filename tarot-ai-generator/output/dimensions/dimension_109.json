It is a time to practice forgiveness, both towards yourself and those around you, in order to move forward with a sense of peace and acceptance.\n\nConsider the impact of your actions and decisions on your future path. Are you holding onto past mistakes or regrets that are hindering your progress? Embrace the opportunity for renewal and rebirth that the Judgement card offers, even if it may feel uncomfortable at first.\n\nRemember, true growth often comes from facing our shadows and embracing our vulnerabilities.
