This card urges you to acknowledge that dwelling excessively on nostalgic memories or outdated beliefs can impede your progress towards a brighter future. Just as a river must flow to remain vibrant, so must you allow yourself to move forward and embrace new opportunities.\n\nBy holding onto what no longer serves you, you risk missing out on the richness of the present moment and the potential for growth that lies ahead. It is essential to confront any misunderstandings or illusions that may be clouding your judgment, allowing yourself to see things clearly and make informed decisions.\n\nTo shift the tides of fortune in your favor, consider how you can release attachments to the past and open yourself up to the possibilities that await you. Embrace the wisdom gained from your experiences, but do not let them overshadow your ability to create a fulfilling and prosperous future. Letting go of what no longer serves you will pave the way for new blessings and opportunities to enter your life.",
