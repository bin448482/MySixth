This card indicates that there may be a tendency to overextend oneself in caring for others, leading to a depletion of personal resources and energy. \n\nWhen it comes to deciphering body language, this card may manifest as a posture of slight fatigue or weariness, a subtle sign that the individual may be feeling drained from constantly putting others' needs before their own. It could also be reflected in gestures of self-soothing or self-protective behaviors, indicating a need for self-care and replenishment.\n\nIn relationships, this card serves as a gentle reminder to prioritize self-care and set healthy boundaries. It suggests taking a step back to reassess where one's energy is being invested and making adjustments to ensure a more balanced approach to giving and receiving. By focusing on self-recovery and adjusting the investment of time and resources, one can cultivate a more sustainable and fulfilling connection with others.",

These could be signs of mutual interest despite the underlying tension suggested by the card. However, if you notice closed-off postures, crossed arms, or avoidance of physical proximity, it may indicate a need to address the conflicts or differences between you.\n\nTo navigate this phase, consider engaging in open and honest communication to clarify any misunderstandings or resolve underlying issues. Be mindful of your own body language as well, as it can influence the dynamics of the relationship. By approaching the situation with patience and understanding, you can work through the challenges presented by the Five of Wands and strengthen the connection between you and the other person.",

This card suggests that the reciprocity you seek may be delayed or hindered by external factors or internal resistance. It is essential to recognize the need for adaptation and flexibility to navigate through this challenging phase.\n\nIn relationships, reciprocity is key to maintaining balance and harmony. When the Wheel of Fortune appears reversed, it indicates a lack of reciprocity or an imbalance in give-and-take. This imbalance may stem from a reluctance to embrace change or a fear of stepping out of familiar patterns. It is crucial to reflect on your own actions and attitudes towards the relationship and consider how you can contribute to creating a more reciprocal dynamic.\n\nTo address this resistance to change, it is important to be open to new possibilities and willing to break free from old habits or beliefs that no longer serve the relationship. Embrace the uncertainty of the unknown and trust that by being adaptable and open-minded, you can find a new path forward towards greater reciprocity and mutual understanding.",
