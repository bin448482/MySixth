Look for areas in your life where you can create more harmony and fairness, allowing for a more balanced and positive energy to attract good fortune.\n\nIn the coming month, focus on letting go of the need to control every aspect of your life and trust in the universe to guide you towards the luck and opportunities that are meant for you. Embrace change and welcome new experiences with an open mind, as this will pave the way for luck to manifest in ways you never imagined.",
